Graceful degradation and service workers are related in how they enhance a web application's resilience. Graceful degradation is the design principle of building apps with full features, while ensuring they still function acceptably when certain technologies are unavailable. Service workers support this by enabling offline functionality, caching essential assets, and responding to network failures. Even if the user loses internet access, a service worker allows the app to continue operating in a basic but functional wayâ€”achieving graceful degradation through technical means. <br>
